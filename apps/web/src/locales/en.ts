      '<p class="p1"><strong>The United States</strong></p><p class="p2">The legal landscape for electronic signatures in the United States is shaped by a combination of federal laws like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/1714/text"><span class="s1"><strong>ESIGN Act</strong></span></a>, state laws such as <a href="https://www.uniformlaws.org/viewdocument/final-act-21?CommunityKey=2c04b76c-2b7d-4399-977e-d5876ba7e034"><span class="s1"><strong>UETA</strong></span></a>, and industry-specific regulations. These laws ensure that electronic signatures are legally valid, secure, and widely accepted across different sectors and jurisdictions.</p><p class="p2">Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN Act) is a federal law enacted in 2000 that gives legal recognition to electronic signatures and records if all parties to a contract choose to use electronic documents and to sign them electronically.</p><p class="p2">The ESIGN Act provides that any law with a requirement for a signature may be satisfied by an electronic signature, allows electronically executed agreements to be presented as evidence in court and prevents denial of legal effect, validity, or enforceability of an electronically signed document solely because it is in electronic form.</p><p class="p2">Under the ESIGN Act, it is recommended that all electronic signature workflows include:</p><ul class="ul1">    <li class="li2"><strong>Consent:</strong> Parties must consent to use electronic signatures.</li>    <li class="li2"><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Companies must provide disclosures about electronic signatures and obtain consent before transactions.</li>    <li class="li2"><strong>Record Retention:</strong> Electronic records must be retained in a form that is accurate, accessible, and capable of being reproduced.</li></ul><p class="p2">The Act facilitates the use of electronic signatures in both interstate and international commerce and specifically excludes any contract or record governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), or any transactions subject to laws governing wills, codicils, testamentary trusts, adoption, divorce, or other family law matters.</p><p class="p2">Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) is a model state law that was finalized in 1999 and has been adopted by 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. UETA provides a legal framework for electronic transactions and ensures that electronic records and signatures have the same legal effect as paper documents and handwritten signatures.</p><p class="p2">In all states that have adopted UETA, the law generally does not apply to birth, wedding, or death certificates, and wills, codicils, and testamentary trusts are also often exempt.</p><p class="p2">While the E-SIGN Act and UETA provide the overarching framework, some states have specific laws and regulations regarding electronic signatures. For example:</p><ul class="ul1">    <li class="li2"><strong>California</strong>: <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=2.5.&part=2.&chapter=&article="><span class="s1"><strong>The California Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (CUETA)</strong></span></a> largely mirrors UETA but includes additional consumer protections.</li>    <li class="li2"><strong>New York:</strong> New York has not adopted UETA but has its own <a href="https://its.ny.gov/nys-technology-law"><span class="s1"><strong>Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA)</strong></span></a>, which provides similar provisions for electronic signatures and records.</li></ul><p class="p3"><br></p><p class="p4"><strong>European Union</strong></p><p class="p5">The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910"><span class="s1"><strong>eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</strong></span></a> (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) Regulation, which was adopted on July 23, 2014, provides a standardized framework for electronic signatures and trust services across the EU. Key points include:</p><ul class="ul1">    <li class="li5"><strong>Legal Validity:</strong> Electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic documents, electronic registered delivery services, and certificate services for website authentication are all legally recognized.</li>    <li class="li5">Types of Electronic Signatures:</li></ul><p class="p6"><strong>Simple Electronic Signature:</strong> Basic electronic data attached to other electronic data.</p><p class="p6"><strong>Advanced Electronic Signature:</strong> Must be uniquely linked to the signer, capable of identifying the signer, created using electronic signature creation data that the signer can use under their sole control, and linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable.</p><p class="p6"><strong>Qualified Electronic Signature:</strong> An advanced electronic signature created by a qualified electronic signature creation device, based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures. It has the highest level of legal standing and is equivalent to a handwritten signature across the EU.</p><p class="p5">While eIDAS provides a unified framework, individual EU member states have their own implementations and additional regulations regarding electronic signatures. For example:</p><ul class="ul1">    <li class="li5"><strong>Germany</strong>: <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vdg/BJNR274510017.html"><span class="s1"><strong>The German Trust Services Act (Vertrauensdienstegesetz, VDG)</strong></span></a> implements eIDAS at the national level, with specific provisions and requirements for trust service providers.</li>    <li class="li5"><strong>France</strong>: <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/article_jo/JORFARTI000035676254"><span class="s1"><strong>The Electronic Signature Decree</strong></span></a>, which defines technical requirements and the legal framework for electronic signatures in compliance with eIDAS.</li></ul><p class="p5">eIDAS establishes a regulatory framework for trust service providers (TSPs), who provide services such as the issuance of certificates for electronic signatures. TSPs must meet stringent requirements to be recognized as qualified trust service providers (QTSPs), ensuring the security and reliability of their services.</p><p class="p7"><br></p><p class="p1"><strong>Georgia</strong></p><p class="p5">The primary legislation governing electronic signatures in Georgia is the Law of Georgia on <a href="https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/3654557?publication=0"><span class="s1"><strong>Electronic Document and Electronic Trust Services</strong></span></a>, enacted to regulate the use of electronic documents, electronic signatures, and trust services. Electronic signatures are legally recognized and have the same legal effect as handwritten signatures.</p><p class="p5">According to Civil Procedure Code of Georgia [Article 134] &bdquo;An electronic document provided for by the Law of Georgia on Electronic Document and Electronic Trust Services has the force of evidence. &ldquo;</p><p class="p5">Georgian domestic legislation replicates the EU directive<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910"><span class="s3"><strong>No. 910/2014</strong></span></a> regulation to electronic signatures, according to which: &ldquo;[Article 25] An electronic signature shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures.</p>',
